## 🧭 Project Overview  
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing HR data to uncover insights about employee headcount, attrition, salary trends, and performance.  
The goal was to provide HR managers with a clear and interactive view of workforce dynamics and retention patterns.

## 🧹 Data Preparation  
- Cleaned and validated data for accuracy.  
- Merged two main tables: **Employees** and **Salary Details**.  
- Fixed date, salary, and department inconsistencies.  
- Added calculated columns and DAX measures for analysis.

## 🧩 Data Modeling  
- Built a one-to-one relationship between tables using *Employee ID*.  
- Created custom DAX measures for KPIs:  
  - 🧍‍♂️ **Headcount**  
  - 🚪 **Leavers**  
  - 📉 **Attrition Rate**  
  - 💰 **Average Net Salary**  
  - ⏳ **Average Tenure**
